          There is a BIG GAP between those who are having success online, and those that have been struggling.
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg font-semibold leading-relaxed mb-5">
          I see over 2,000+ people EVERY DAY who sign up for a free ClickFunnels trial, 
          with hopes and dreams of launching their online business
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal leading-relaxed mb-5">
          But unfortunately the majority of them never get a funnel live before their trial 
          is over and they have to start paying their monthly fees
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-[28px] font-bold mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-[1.4]">
          Not because the software is hard (it's not...)
        </h3>
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-[28px] font-bold mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-[1.4]">
          And not because they aren't ambitious (they are)
        </h3>
        <h3 className="text-2xl md:text-[28px] font-bold mb-6 text-gray-600 leading-[1.4]">
          ...and then making their first sale online.
        </h3>

        <h3 className="text-[32px] font-extrabold my-10 text-red-600 uppercase leading-[1.4]">
          Inside of that GAP are all of the other things they need to do, like:
        </h3>

        <div className="text-left max-w-[700px] mx-auto bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-md">

        <p className="text-lg font-normal leading-relaxed mt-8 mb-4">
          It's all of these OTHER steps that people get stuck on, and that's why many 
          people struggle to actually make real money online.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-normal leading-relaxed mb-4">
          But - after someone has all of their products, graphics, copy, etc and that gap is FILLED, 
          then success becomes INFINITELY easier.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg font-semibold leading-relaxed mt-8 mb-4">
          So, I've been sitting here for the last few months trying to figure out
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-[32px] font-extrabold my-10 text-red-600 uppercase leading-[1.4]">
          HOW CAN I FILL THIS GAP FOR PEOPLE, SO THEY CAN HAVE SUCCESS FASTER!?!
